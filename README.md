# Third Eye (WPF)
**Last Updated:** 06 March 2014

This is the code repository for a WPF app called "Third Eye".<br/>
It is called as such because it's function is to serve as my eyes behind my head.<br/>
It is an app that displays camera feeds (connected to the PC).<br/>

This app uses my own Window template which includes:
- Dark/White Theme
- Color Schemes
- Always On-Top option
- In-place Collapse/Expand
